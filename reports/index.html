### 📊 Evaluation Metrics

##### AnswerRelevancy
- **Score:** 0.00
- **Reason:** The score is 0.00 because the output &#x27;Australia&#x27; does not address the question about the continent on which Australia is located, making it completely irrelevant.

##### ContextualPrecision
- **Score:** 0.00
- **Reason:** The score is 0.00 because the first node in retrieval contexts, which states &#x27;The retrieval context only provides the name \&quot;Australia\&quot; without specifying that it is both a country and a continent, hence it is not sufficiently informative to determine the expected output.&#x27;, is irrelevant and should be ranked lower.

##### ContextualRecall

##### ContextualRelevancy
- **Score:** 0.00
- **Reason:** The score is 0.00 because the context only mentions &#x27;Australia&#x27; without providing any relevant information about the continent it is located on.

##### Hallucination
- **Score:** 1.00
- **Reason:** The score is 1.00 because the actual output &#x27;Australia&#x27; contradicts the expected context which requires stating that &#x27;Australia is located on the continent of Australia.&#x27; This incomplete and inaccurate response leads to a high hallucination score.
